# EY_Case_DataScience_Solution
Solution to the EY Hiring Campus Recruitment 2024 Take-home case


## Case description 
Our client, the City of Toronto, approached EY to help them rethink mobility in the metropolitan area. With a very
low level of analytical maturity, the City wanted to understand how to leverage the data available to them.
- Your senior manager asks you, using the tool of your choice (Python, R, SAS, MatLab, other), to analyze one or more
datasets provided by the client and to prepare at least one predictive model or data visualization allowing to understand the
state of the transportation network (bike path, road network, public transportation).
- You will need to present your analysis to your senior manager in a language that the client can understand.
- Be prepared to answer technical questions from your senior manager about your approach.
- Your senior manager expects you to spend 2-3 hours building your analysis.
- You can answer the question partially (e.g., focus only on the bicycle network) since other analysts on your team will be handling other
visualizations.
- You can complement your analysis with any other external dataset you deem relevant.
- You may present in English or French. You will have 10 minutes to present followed by a 10 minute question period.
